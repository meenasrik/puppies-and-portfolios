✨Lightning Talk: Portfolios? ✨<br />
Answer some basic questions about Portfolio websites. Who needs one? What is a portfolio site? What should you include? When should you start building a portfolio? Where can I get ideas and inspiration? Why should you maintain your site when you aren't actively job hunting? Why should you even have a portfolio site?

This talk is a quick intro to portfolio sites and what this meetup will be over time.
