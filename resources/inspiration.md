# Find Inspiration and Ideas

This is a collection of links for ideas and inspiration when building your portfolio site.   You can create a PR to add a link to any of the existing categories, or feel free to add your own category. Also, feel free to add comments or images to your links to explain what it is or why you like that resource.

## Other portfolios
- [Developer Portfolio List on Emma Bostian's Github](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios) - Collection of portfolio sites built by other developers. It is always fun to see what other people in the field have created.

## Layout / Typography / Graphic Design Books
- [Making and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop by Timothy Samara](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Grid-Graphic-Workshop/dp/1592531253) 

## Pre-made Templates
I don't usually like to use pre-made templates, but I like to look at them for ideas I can borrow.

## Misc. 
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) has a lot of great boards that others have put together with different sources of inspiration. I like to search for things like 'magazine layouts', 'web design', 'landing pages', and 'layouts'.
