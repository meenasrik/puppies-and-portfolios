# Find Inspiration and Ideas

This is a collection of links for ideas and inspiration when building your portfolio site.   You can create a PR to add a link to any of the existing categories, or feel free to add your own category. Also, feel free to add comments or images to your links to explain what it is or why you like that resource.

## Other portfolios (Collections/Lists)
- [Developer Portfolio List on Emma Bostian's Github](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios) - Collection of portfolio sites built by other developers. It is always fun to see what other people in the field have created.
- [Personal Sites](https://personalsit.es/) another collection of personal websites. This site includes tags to help you know a little about each site before clicking over to it

## Other Portfolios (Specific Sites)
- [Meyerweb.com](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2020/04/15/pseudo-randomly-adding-illustrations-with-css/) This site was recently updated and the new design is really nice! Linked to a specific blog post that talks about Pseudo-randomly adding images inbetween his posts (like dividers) just using CSS! 
- [Ali Spittel](https://www.alispit.tel/) Ali has a pretty simple design, but it works really well. I love the little bits of fun and interaction she adds to her site. Try randomly clicking around anywhere on the page to see what I mean! Also highly recommend her post [Building a Kickass Portfolio](https://dev.to/aspittel/building-a-kickass-portfolio-28ph)

## Layout / Typography / Graphic Design Books
- [Making and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop by Timothy Samara](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Grid-Graphic-Workshop/dp/1592531253) 

## Pre-made Templates
I don't usually like to use pre-made templates, but I like to look at them for ideas I can borrow. 
- [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/)
- [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress)


## Misc. 
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) has a lot of great boards that others have put together with different sources of inspiration. I like to search for things like 'magazine layouts', 'web design', 'landing pages', and 'layouts'.
